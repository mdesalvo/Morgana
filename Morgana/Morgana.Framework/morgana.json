Use for invoices, profiles, reports, comparisons, or any data benefiting from visual hierarchy rather than bothering the user with a long wall-of-text.\n\n=== COMPOSITIONAL DESIGN ===\n\nRich cards are built by COMPOSING 7 basic component types, like LEGO blocks. Each component serves a specific semantic purpose, and you combine them to create the information structure you need.\n\nThink compositionally:\n• Start with the DATA you need to present (invoice fields, profile info, report sections)\n• Identify the SEMANTIC NATURE of each piece (labeled field? prose? list? status?)\n• Choose the RIGHT COMPONENT for each piece based on its nature\n• GROUP related components logically using 'section' for hierarchy\n• SEPARATE distinct groups with 'divider' for visual clarity\n\nThe goal: transform unstructured data into a scannable, organized visual presentation that helps users quickly find what they need.\n\n=== ROOT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY) ===\n{\n  \"title\": \"string (required)\",\n  \"subtitle\": \"string (optional)\",\n  \"components\": [array of component objects (required)]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Root MUST have 'title' and 'components' keys. NEVER use 'sections', 'data', or other wrappers at root level.\n\n=== COMPONENT SELECTION GUIDE ===\n\nBefore choosing a component, ask yourself:\n\n📊 LABELED DATA (field + value)?\n→ Single field: key_value\n→ Multiple fields, vertical flow: multiple key_value components\n→ Multiple fields, compact side-by-side: grid (2-4 columns)\n\n📝 TEXT CONTENT (narrative/explanation)?\n→ Important message/warning: text_block with style=\"bold\"\n→ Regular explanation: text_block with style=\"normal\"\n→ Secondary note/footnote: text_block with style=\"muted\" or \"small\"\n\n📋 MULTIPLE ITEMS (list of things)?\n→ Sequential/ordered steps: list with style=\"numbered\"\n→ Related but unordered: list with style=\"bullet\"\n→ Compact/plain listing: list with style=\"plain\"\n\n🏷️ STATUS/TAG?\n→ badge (success/warning/error/info/neutral)\n\n📦 LOGICAL GROUPING?\n→ section (can nest other components, max depth 3)\n\n➖ VISUAL SEPARATION?\n→ divider\n\n=== COMPONENT DICTIONARY (7 TYPES) ===\n\n1️⃣ text_block - Narrative text with visual styling\n   \n   When to use:\n   - Multi-sentence explanations or descriptions\n   - Warnings, alerts, or important notices\n   - Contextual notes or clarifications\n   - ANY prose content that isn't a labeled field\n   \n   When NOT to use:\n   - Labeled data (use key_value instead)\n   - Lists of items (use list instead)\n   - Single-word labels (use badge instead)\n   \n   Properties:\n   • content (string, required): The text to display\n   • style (string, optional): \"normal\" (default) | \"bold\" (emphasis) | \"muted\" (secondary) | \"small\" (footnote)\n   \n   Examples:\n   {\"type\": \"text_block\", \"content\": \"⚠️ Payment is 53 days overdue. Late fees may apply.\", \"style\": \"bold\"}\n   {\"type\": \"text_block\", \"content\": \"This invoice reflects services rendered in October 2025.\", \"style\": \"muted\"}\n\n2️⃣ key_value - Label-value pair for structured data fields\n   \n   When to use:\n   - ANY labeled piece of information (field name + value)\n   - Invoice fields, profile attributes, dates, amounts, IDs\n   - When you have \"Label: Value\" semantics\n   \n   When NOT to use:\n   - Unlabeled text (use text_block instead)\n   - Multiple items without individual labels (use list instead)\n   - Need compact multi-column layout (use grid instead)\n   \n   Properties:\n   • key (string, required): The field label/name\n   • value (string, required): The field value\n   • emphasize (boolean, optional, default=false): Visual emphasis (bold, larger font) for important values\n   \n   Examples:\n   {\"type\": \"key_value\", \"key\": \"Customer\", \"value\": \"[Company Name]\"}\n   {\"type\": \"key_value\", \"key\": \"Due Date\", \"value\": \"15/12/2025\", \"emphasize\": true}\n   {\"type\": \"key_value\", \"key\": \"Invoice Number\", \"value\": \"INV-2025-001\"}\n\n3️⃣ divider - Visual horizontal separator line\n   \n   When to use:\n   - Separate distinct logical sections\n   - Create visual breathing room between groups\n   - Mark transitions (e.g., between details and summary)\n   \n   When NOT to use:\n   - Between every component (overuse clutters)\n   - Inside tightly related groups (use section instead)\n   \n   Properties: None (type-only component)\n   \n   Example:\n   {\"type\": \"divider\"}\n\n4️⃣ list - Vertical enumeration of related items\n   \n   When to use:\n   - Multiple related items in sequential order\n   - Invoice line items, feature lists, task lists\n   - When order matters (numbered) or items are related (bullet)\n   - Items are heterogeneous or have narrative flow\n   \n   When NOT to use:\n   - Items are labeled key-value pairs (use multiple key_value or grid)\n   - Need compact side-by-side layout (use grid)\n   - Single item (just use text_block or key_value)\n   \n   Properties:\n   • items (array of strings, required): The list items\n   • style (string, optional): \"bullet\" (default, • prefix) | \"numbered\" (1. 2. 3.) | \"plain\" (no prefix)\n   \n   Examples:\n   {\"type\": \"list\", \"items\": [\"Premium 100Mbps Plan: €90.00\", \"Static IP Address: €5.00\", \"Installation Fee: €35.00\"], \"style\": \"bullet\"}\n   {\"type\": \"list\", \"items\": [\"Step 1: Review invoice\", \"Step 2: Approve payment\", \"Step 3: Submit\"], \"style\": \"numbered\"}\n   {\"type\": \"list\", \"items\": [\"Invoice #001\", \"Invoice #002\", \"Invoice #003\"], \"style\": \"plain\"}\n\n5️⃣ section - Nestable container for logical grouping with heading\n   \n   When to use:\n   - Group related components under a common heading\n   - Create hierarchical structure (e.g., \"Billing Details\" → customer info fields)\n   - Organize complex cards into logical sections\n   \n   When NOT to use:\n   - Single component doesn't need wrapping\n   - Already at max nesting depth (3 levels)\n   - Purely for styling (use divider for visual separation)\n   \n   Properties:\n   • title (string, required): Section heading/label\n   • subtitle (string, optional): Secondary description under title\n   • components (array of components, required): Nested child components\n   \n   Nesting rules:\n   • Maximum depth: 3 section levels from root\n   • ✅ ALLOWED: components → section → section → section (depth 3)\n   • ❌ FORBIDDEN: components → section → section → section → section (depth 4)\n   \n   Examples:\n   {\"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"Billing Details\", \"components\": [{\"type\": \"key_value\", \"key\": \"Period\", \"value\": \"October 2025\"}, {\"type\": \"key_value\", \"key\": \"Status\", \"value\": \"Pending\"}]}\n   {\"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"Line Items\", \"subtitle\": \"Services rendered\", \"components\": [{\"type\": \"list\", \"items\": [\"Consulting: €800\", \"Development: €450\"], \"style\": \"bullet\"}]}\n\n6️⃣ grid - Multi-column layout for compact key-value presentation\n   \n   When to use:\n   - Multiple RELATED key-value pairs that benefit from side-by-side layout\n   - Compact presentation of homogeneous data (e.g., profile fields, stats)\n   - When horizontal space is more valuable than vertical\n   \n   When NOT to use:\n   - Items are heterogeneous or need vertical flow (use multiple key_value)\n   - Complex nested content (grid items are simple key-value only)\n   - Less than 2 items (just use key_value)\n   \n   Properties:\n   • columns (integer, required): Number of columns (2-4 recommended)\n   • items (array of objects, required): Each object has \"key\" (string) and \"value\" (string)\n   \n   Examples:\n   {\"type\": \"grid\", \"columns\": 2, \"items\": [{\"key\": \"Name\", \"value\": \"[User Name]\"}, {\"key\": \"Age\", \"value\": \"30\"}, {\"key\": \"City\", \"value\": \"Rome\"}, {\"key\": \"Country\", \"value\": \"Italy\"}]}\n   {\"type\": \"grid\", \"columns\": 3, \"items\": [{\"key\": \"Q1\", \"value\": \"€45K\"}, {\"key\": \"Q2\", \"value\": \"€52K\"}, {\"key\": \"Q3\", \"value\": \"€48K\"}]}\n\n7️⃣ badge - Compact status indicator or categorical tag\n   \n   When to use:\n   - Status indicators (Paid, Pending, Overdue, Active, Inactive)\n   - Categorical tags (Priority, Type, Level)\n   - Alert levels or severity indicators\n   - ANY single-word or short label needing visual emphasis\n   \n   When NOT to use:\n   - Multi-word explanations (use text_block)\n   - Labeled data fields (use key_value)\n   \n   Properties:\n   • text (string, required): Badge label/content\n   • variant (string, optional): \"success\" (green) | \"warning\" (orange) | \"error\" (red) | \"info\" (blue) | \"neutral\" (purple, default)\n   \n   Color semantics:\n   - success: Positive states (Paid, Active, Completed, Approved)\n   - warning: Attention needed (Pending, Due Soon, Review Required)\n   - error: Negative states (Overdue, Failed, Rejected, Inactive)\n   - info: Informational (New, Updated, Beta, Draft)\n   - neutral: Generic tags without semantic meaning\n   \n   Examples:\n   {\"type\": \"badge\", \"text\": \"Paid\", \"variant\": \"success\"}\n   {\"type\": \"badge\", \"text\": \"Overdue\", \"variant\": \"error\"}\n   {\"type\": \"badge\", \"text\": \"Review Required\", \"variant\": \"warning\"}\n   {\"type\": \"badge\", \"text\": \"Premium\", \"variant\": \"neutral\"}\n\n=== CRITICAL RULES ===\n\n1. Root object MUST have 'title' and 'components' keys (NEVER 'sections', 'data', or other wrappers)\n2. EVERY component object MUST have 'type' as the FIRST property\n3.
